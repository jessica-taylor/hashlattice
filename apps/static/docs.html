        <h3>HashLattice</h3>
        <p>A distributed network based on hash codes and lattices.</p>
        <h3>Why do this?</h3>
        <p>Peer-to-peer systems such as Bittorrent and Bitcoin can perform
        useful tasks without central authority.  However, each of these systems
        is difficult to program and requires its users to install different
        software for each application.  With HashLattice, you could implement a
        peer-to-peer system by only writing code related to the system's
        functionality without worrying about how the underlying peer-to-peer
        network functions, or managing dependencies.  Users could use the
        system simply by visiting a location in their Web browser after
        installing HashLattice software, but without having to install
        different software for each application.  In theory, this system could
        allow the implementation of systems such as Facebook with no central
        web server or authority, code sharing without worrying about dependency
        management, Bitcoin (without installing the Bitcoin software), and web
        applications using Bitcoin.</p>
        <h3>Distributed file sharing</h3>
        <p>HashLattice is built on a base of distributed file sharing.  It is
        possible to assign hash codes to documents and use this hash code as
        the name of the document.  Then, a protocol such as BitTorrent can be
        used to download the document from peers.  BitTorrent already
        implements this system using magnet links.</p>
        <p>Rather that share arbitrary binary files, HashLattice allows the
        sharing of <em>data values</em>.  Data values are like JSON objects: it
        is possible to represent strings, numbers, arrays, and dictionaries.
        Additionally, byte arrays are also considered to be data objects (which
        allows efficiently representing binary files).  Data values can be
        encoded in binary, so the file sharing network can easily be adapted to
        share data objects.</p>
        <h3>Computations</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, it's useful to distribute a compressed version of a file,
        rather than the file itself.  But what if the user doesn't have the
        decompression algorithm installed?  In this case, you might consider
        providing the compressed file along with the decompression
        algorithm.</p>
        <p>HashLattice allows doing this (and more) using computations.  Think
        of a computation as a bundle containing both data and some Javascript
        code for transforming it.  The code is run in a sandbox, so even
        untrusted code can be run safely.  The actual data objects shared on
        the HashLattice network are computations, rather than the original data
        objects.</p>
        <h3>Dependency management</h3>
        <p>What if you want to distribute multiple files that are compressed
        with the same algorithm?  It would be wasteful to distribute the same
        decompression algorithm multiple times.</p>
        <p>To handle this issue, HashLattice allows computations to fetch data
        based on its hash code.  So, you could distribute the compressed file
        along with some code that will fetch the decompression algorithm's
        source code (using the hash of the source) and then use `eval()` to run
        the code on the compressed file.  This will prevent the user from
        having to download the compression multiple times, as it will be
        cached.</p>
        <p>This facility can do more than just make decompression easier.  It
        is possible to create files that are derived from existing files.  For
        example, there might be an old version of a document already in the
        network when you want to publish a new version.  You can publish a
        computation that uses the diff between the old and new versions, along
        with the old file, to construct the new version.  Users who have
        already downloaded the old file will only need to download the
        diff.</p>

        <p>It is also possible to split a file up into many different pieces
        that are combined with some decoding function.  The decoding function
        may perform functions such as concatenation, xor, and decryption on the
        parts.  Then, the owner can use a computation that retrieves the pieces
        and feeds them through the decoding function.  For comparison, see the
        <a href="http://offsystem.sourceforge.net/">OFF system</a>.<p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Using `eval()` like this is inconvenient.  This is why HashLattice
        allows computations to return arbitrary values, which can contain
        functions.  A <em>value</em> is defined the same way a data value is defined
        (it can be a string, number, list, or dictionary), but it can also be a
        function that takes values as arguments and returns values.  The
        decompression algorithm used previously could be specified as a
        computation returning a decompression function, rather than a
        computation returning source code.</p>

        <p>Functions make it easy to interface HashLattice with programming
        languages.  Most scripting languages (including Javascript, Python,
        Ruby, and Perl) have an easy way to represent values, and other
        languages (such as Java and C++) can represent them with a bit more
        difficulty.  Therefore, it is possible to provide a library that can be
        used like this:</p>

        <p><pre style="text-align: left"><code>
        import hl 
        lib = hl.getFromHash('<sha256 hash code>')
        lib.function(5)</code></pre></p>

        <p>This will often be much easier than installing language-specific libraries,
which may or may not even exist.  Since HashLattice includes dependency
management, it can be used like a package manager for Javascript code that can
be called from many different languages.  The HashLattice package provided to
the host language can call an external process to handle function calls.</p>
        <h3>User Interface</h3>
        <p>When a URL of the form `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<hash>` is visited,
        the browser downloads a data value corresponding to the given hash and
        interprets it as an HTML page.  The page may be downloaded from peers
        in the network; no central web server is necessary.  The Javascript on
        the HTML page will be able to access HashLattice functions such as
        retrieving documents from their hash value.  With user permission, it
        will be able to put data in the system.  This enables easy distribution
        of applications that work with HashLattice: simply distribute the hash
        of a computation returning the application's HTML page.  Obviously, it
        is also possible for the browser to display file types other than
        HTML.</p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>So far, the system can do a lot, but it is very static.  Documents
        representing computations are inserted into the system and can be
        downloaded and used to define new documents, but nothing really changes
        over time except that more files get added.</p>

        <p>Enter variables.  As the name suggests, variables specify a value
        that may change over time.  Each computer in the network will store a
        current data value for all variables it knows about.  It will
        communicate with other computers to update its value.</p>

        <p>If I already have one value for a particular variable, and I hear
        about another value from another computer on the network, how do I know
        how to update my value?  Each variable specifies exactly how to do this
        with a merge function.  `merge` should take two values (the current one
        the computer knows about, and the one it heard from somewhere else) and
        produce a new value.  Think of `merge` as either choosing the better
        value between the two, or combining the best of both values into a
        unified whole.  Formally, `merge` will usually be a least upper bound
        operator in a [semilattice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice).
        Variables also specify a default value.  HashLattice web pages are
        allowed to fetch the current best value for any variable.</p>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>Variables are quite powerful.  Consider a variable that stores the
        latest version of a document that has been signed by a particular
        public key.  To merge 2 documents, select the properly signed document
        with the latest time stamp, or `null` (the default) if neither document
        is valid.</p>

        <p>Now it is possible to create a webpage that will fetch this
        variable.  It can display whatever document is associated with the
        variable.  The result is that the webpage is automatically updated
        whenever a new version of the document is published.  Since the initial
        HTML/Javascript for the webpage remains the same, the webpage will
        maintain the same hash code even when the document is updated.</p>

        <p>Much more is possible with variables.  Perhaps you want to publish a
        list of messages signed with a particular public key (think Twitter).
        Then define a variable representing a set of all messages signed by a
        particular person.  To merge two sets, take their union (and discard
        messages that are not properly signed).</p>

        <p>It is possible to create a messaging service (like Facebook) this
        way.  For each user, have one variable corresponding to a list of
        (encrypted) messages they have sent to other people, and another
        corresponding to their list of friends (which is a simple versioned
        document).  Now it is possible to create a webpage showing all messages
        addressed to a user (which requires prompting the user for their
        decryption key, of course).  It will first fetch the user's friends
        list, then fetch the list of messages sent by each friend in the list,
        filtering messages to ensure they are sent to this particular person.
        This is not the most efficient system, but other more efficient systems
        (using indexes) can also be implemented using variables.</p>

        <p>Surprisingly, Bitcoin can also be implemented using variables.  The
        block chain can be represented as a linked list, where each node in the
        list stores both a single block and the hash code of the
        chronologically previous node.  The main variable would be "longest
        valid block chain".  Merge block chains by checking that they are both
        valid and proceeding to select the longest valid one (choosing the old
        value if both are equally valid and long).  For efficiency, it will be
        useful to cache some computations, such as a function that determines
        the validity of a block chain up to a given block, in addition to
        account balances at this block.  This function can be used recursively
        (with appropriate caching) to evaluate later blocks.</p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>The main data type of HashLattice is a variant of YAML.  It is exactly like
YAML, except that it supports some nice template features for including other
files. These template features are !includeYaml for including another YAML
file, !hashYaml for including the hash code of another YAML file,
!includeBinary for including binary data in the YAML, and !hashBinary for
including the hash code of a binary file.</p>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>The main programming language used in HashLattice is Javascript.  It
        may be good to support additional languages eventually.  HashLattice
        data can easily be manipulated in Javascript.  Only a subset of
        language features are allowed: no IO, no randomness, no checking the
        time, etc.</p>

        <p>The intention is that it's as close to a purely functional
        programming language you can get while still allowing internal data to
        be mutated.  This restriction can be accomplished with a Javascript
        sandbox.</p>
        <h3>Computations</h3>
        <p>A <em>computation</em> is a YAML file that produces a value and can
        access a few functions that are guaranteed to be deterministic.
        Specifically, the form of the computation is data:</p>
        <pre style="text-align: left"><code>
        data: 
          pages:
            index.html: !includeBinary ./index.html
            image.png: !includeBinary ./image.png
        code: |
          function(hl) {
            // retrieve the path from hl and return a Javascript object containing
            // 3 elements here: headers, api (an API specified for individual
            // sites), and content
          }

        </pre></code>
        <p>Every computation produces a deterministic result when evaluated.
        The code is allowed to call a `evalComputation(comp)` function, which
        takes a computation and returns its evaluation.</p>
        <h3>Hash Codes</h3>
        <p>The main hash function used in HashLattice is SHA256.  It is
        possible to find the hash of a data value by finding the hash of its
        canonical binary representation.  Specifically, it is possible to find
        hash codes of computations, as they are all data values.  The system
        (and eventually, the network) should store a mapping from hash codes to
        computations.  Then, it is possible to provide a function that maps
        from a hash code to the result of evaluating the computation with this
        hash code.  This function is provided to computations and is called
        `getHash(code)`.  Like `evalComputation`, `getHash` will take advantage
        of caching.  Hash codes can be easily used for dependency management,
        as explained in the applications section of this document.</p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>(TODO add variable section once we have it setup in yaml)</p>
        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>HashLattice provides an API, which is accessible in a Javascript
        shell, other programming languages, and HashLattice web pages.  The API
        contains the following functions (TODO, this is incomplete):</p>
        <p>
        <pre style="text-align: left"><code>
- `evalComputation`: Given a computation, evaluate it.  This uses caching.
- `getHash`: Given a hash code for a computation, try to download and evaluate it.  This also using caching.
- `getHashComputation`: Given a hash code for a computation, try to download it.  This also uses caching.
- `putHash`: Given a computation, store it in the system (indexed by its hash code) and allow peers to download it.
- `getVar`: Given a variable hash, return the current data value for the variable.  This may require querying peers.
- `putVar`: Given a variable computation and a new data value, merge the
current value with the new value.  This may cause the new value to be pushed to
other computers in the network.</pre></code></p>
